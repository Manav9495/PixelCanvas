# PixelCanvas
PixelCanvas is a website created by Manav Tyagi focused on providing high-quality wallpapers with the slogan: "Color Your World, One Pixel at a Time." The project showcases a journey from initial hand-drawn sketches to low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, ultimately leading to a nearly complete website.
